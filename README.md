# match_making

Matchmaking has always been an important part of relationships. There are many algorithms available including ELO rating system, matching percentage and etc.

In this repo, we are trying to use **Gale Shapley Algorithm** to create a stable pairing or stable matching.

## Further Improvement
- Gale Shapley Algorithm is assuming there are equal numbers for both male and female, hence further improvement can be made to cater unequal male and female count.
